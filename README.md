# DC-Slide-Show
Slide Show Web App For Digital Ciggz

Menu Board Instructions:

This menu board is SO much better now with more flexibility and the ability to cache the menu to the browser meaning that even if the internet goes down on the device the menu will continue to run.

The HTML file has a series of comments that will help guide anyone on how to add new slides to the file.

Click anywhere on the slide to rotate to desired orientation based on the position of the screen. 

Donâ€™t worry, the file will remember the orientation, but, if the device is shut down you may have to redo the orientation of the slides again. 

You can bookmark the slideshow in the browser for easy access to the file.	

The recommended browser to use would be the FREE Fullscreen Browser found in the Play Store.
	
Any questions? Feel free to text me and I can make adjustments on the fly.
